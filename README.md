# FrogConsole

 FrogConsole is a customizable In-Game console for Godot 4.2. FrogConsole uniquely features its own Turing Complete scripting language, FrogScript, that allows you to write and execute programs. With it, you can write complex macros that are impossible in other consoles. FrogConsole  allows for custom commands to interface with your Godot Projects.
